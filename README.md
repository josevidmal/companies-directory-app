## User Story

- As a User
- I want to be able to register a company with information like name, date of constitution, company type and comments, also being able to update such information or delete a complete company record if needed
- So that I can keep track of all the companies that get my attention, to make business with or to purchase from them. 

## BDD

- GIVEN a companies directory website
- WHEN I load the homepage
- THEN I am presented with a Header with the application name, a Footer with the developer contacts 
and a Main section with an Add Company button, a table of registered companies, displaying each company's name, date of contitution, type and Edit and Eliminate buttons
if there are no companies saved in the database, a heading displays: "Without companies..."
- WHEN I click on the Add Company button
- THEN I am presented with a modal to enter a company's name, date of constitution, type and comments, this modal has an Add button to submit the information
- WHEN I click on the Add button, with all the required fields
- THEN the company is saved into the database, a success message is displayed and the homepage table is updated,
however, if I forget to fill in the name, date of constitution or type, the company is not saved and a message is displayed asking me to fill in the required information.
Also, if I enter a future date I get a message asking me to select a valid date (today or before).
- WHEN I click on the Edit button
- THEN I am presented with a modal with all the fields already filled with the selected company
- WHEN I modify the information on any field and click the Modify button in the modal
- THEN the company information is updated in the database, a success message is displayed and the homepage table is updated
- WHEN I click on the Eliminate button
- THEN I am presented with a modal displaying the message "Are you sure you want to delete the company?", and Accept and Cancel buttons
- WHEN I click on the Accept button
- THEN the company record is deleted from the database, a message displays "The company has been deleted" and the homepage table is updated
